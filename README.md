# Katz centrality under local (and global) differential privacy using the snap stanford library and datasets.

Naive methods (randomized) and more complex ones for computing the Katz centraly under both Local and Global differential privacy unsing the snap stanford library.
The code is messy but you should be able to easily run the important functions (loading the graphs and plotting the performances of the algo)
